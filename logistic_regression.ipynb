But here, the regression coefficent for experience is 0.43, indicat‐ing that more experience leads to a greater likelihood of a premium account. This means  that  our  model  outputs  very  large  values  for  people  with  lots  of  experi‐ence.  But  we  know  that  the  actual  values  must  be  at  most  1,  which  means  thatnecessarily  very  large  outputs  (and  therefore  very  large  values  of  experience)correspond  to  very  large  negative  values  of  the  error  term.
